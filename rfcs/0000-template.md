- Title:
- Date proposed: yyyy-mm-dd
- RFC PR: https://github.com/snappizz/rfcs/pull/0000 (update this number after RFC PR has been filed)

# Summary

Short description, 1-2 sentences.

# Motivation

Introduce the topic. If this is a particularly esoteric or not-well-known section of SuperCollider, a detailed explanation of the background is recommended.

Some example points of discussion:

- What specific problems are you facing right now that you're trying to address?
- Are there any previous discussions? Link to them and summarize them (don't force your readers to read them though!).
- Is there any precedent set by other software? If so, link to resources.

# Specification

A concrete, thorough explanation of what is being planned.

# Drawbacks

Carefully consider every possible objection and issue with your proposal. This section should be updated as feedback comes in from discussion.

# Unresolved Questions

Are there any portions of your proposal which need to be discussed with the community before the RFC can proceed? Be careful here -- an RFC with a lot of remaining questions is likely to be stalled. If your RFC is mostly unresolved questions and not too much substance, it may not be ready.
